## About The Project

![Screen Shot](screenshots/image.png)

(This is how the main folder of this repo should look like).

Why I built that repo?
Here's why:
* Someone would need a "base" for coding their bot and is very lazy (or maybe not) to follow the official discord.js guide :tada:
* To make my (and yours) life easier (I needed the simpliest bot). :green_heart:
* For fun. I like that type of stuff.

It is just the full functional base. The name of the bot, it's profile picture, are dependent from the BOT Token you will put in the config.json file.


## Built With



* [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs)
* [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
* [javaScript]()

## Getting Started

101 - How to configure the bot and how to launch it.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* node.js
* npm

Installation tutorial:
```sh
> sudo apt install nodejs && sudo apt install npm     - (Ubuntu/Debian/LMint)
> sudo pacman -S nodejs && sudo pacman -S npm     - (Arch/Manjaro)
> sudo dnf install nodejs && sudo dnf install npm     - (Fedora)
> https://nodejs.org/en/download    - (Windows / macOS / Linux standalone packages)

```

### Installation

1. Clone git repo somewhere
2. Go to the folder, open terminal/cmd in that place, enter ***npm install*** to install all the needed node modules.
3. Rename confignew.json to config.json
4. Enter the config.json
5. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
6. Login to Discord with your account
7. Click on Applications
8. Create New Application, enter its name and accept ToS
9. Click "BOT" Bookmark, enter BOT name you want to use and click Reset Token
10. **Copy Token (DO NOT PUBLISH THE TOKEN ANYWHERE!)**
11. Paste the token into config.json file (into token: "here")
12. Go back to Developer Portal, then click OAuth2 bookmark
13. **copy ClientID** and paste it into config.json file (into clientId: "here")
14. Go to Discord app, go to settings, scroll down to Developer Settings, enable them
15. Go back to homescreen, then click the right button on your server on which you want to add the bot, then **copy server ID**
16. Paste it into config.json (into guildId: "here")
17. **(Optionally)** Enter the /commands/(any .js) file and customize the messages' outputs.
18. ***When your Bot is ready to deploy (You've set the Token, ClientID, GuildID, {Bot's name, Bot's Profile Picture and Bot's description - on Developer Portal), it is time to invite the bot to your server:***
Paste the bot's ClientID into the link:
discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=***pastetheclientIDhere***&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

19. When the bot joined the server, it is time to **Launch the bot:**
20. Open cmd / terminal
21. cd to your cloned repo directory
22. Check if you chose the right directory: **ls**  command on macOS/Linux or **dir** on Windows OS.
23. If yes - run the command: **node index.js**
24. Bot should output in the terminal window the message: **karolBot | Deployed! Running instance name: [YourBotNameHere#0000]**.

***Or.... if it does not work... open Issue on GitHub and we'll solve the problem together :cat:***
